## Running an example

Each example has its own README with specific instructions. Generally you'll need to:

1. Create a [Notion integration](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations)
2. Share your test page or database with the integration
3. Set up environment variables (usually in a `.env` file)
4. Install dependencies with `npm install`
5. Run the example

## Contributing examples

Have an example you'd like to share? See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on adding examples.

When adding an example:

- Include a clear README explaining what it does and how to use it
- Add any necessary configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Make sure it's tested and works as documented
- Keep it focused on demonstrating a specific technique or integration

## Other languages

Currently we only have JavaScript examples, but we'd love to add examples in other languages. If you've built something in Python, Ruby, Go, or another language, please contribute!
